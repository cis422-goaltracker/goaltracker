## Usage
On the home page, you can see a list of your goals. These goals can be sorted in six ways for ease of use. 

These include "Current Goals", "Overdue Goals", "Completed Goals" and "All Goals."
And within those, you can view them by "Priority" or "Category"

Other buttons include the fuctionality to add, completed, edit/view a goal as well as view analysis for that goal.

If any of the windows happen to scale incorrectly, we would suggest to try changing your screen resolution. 

Home page is shown below: 

![Homepage](https://github.com/cis422-goaltracker/goaltracker/blob/master/images/homepage.png)

### To Add a Goal:
On the home page, select button labeled "Add Goal"

This will direct you to a saving page labeled "Add/Edit Goal"

Enter the name of your goal, the day the goal is due (MM/DD/YY, HH:MM format) as well as the category (user defined) and Priority. Priority can be chosen through pre-defined buttons, low, medium and high.

While not required, the GoalTracker application allows you to add subgoals and notes or "memos" as a helpful tool toward productivity. More details on instruction of adding, deleting and completing subgoals can be found below.

Once filled out, select "Save" button for save events

Check the event has been saved or not, click the close button(red) on the top left page of "Add/Edit Goal", then view the list of goals you have to make sure the one you recently added is there.

For more information on goals and subgoals and the things you can do with them, see "To Add a subgoal" and "To Delete a Goal and Subgoal" and "To Complete a Goal or Subgoal"

![Add Goal Image](https://github.com/cis422-goaltracker/goaltracker/blob/master/images/add:edit.png)

### To Edit/View a goal:
On the homepage, navigate to a pre-existing goal that you would like to edit. Select it in the dropdown box and select the 'Edit/View' button. This window, similiarly to the "add a goal" window  has all the same fields, but now has the information that you had entered before. 

To change anything, make your changes in this window and select save.

Note that to the right of "Due Date" you will be able to see how many days until this goal is set to be due.

### To Add a Subgoal:
On the home page, 

select either "Add Goal". if you want to add a subgoal to a new goal you will create 
-OR- 
Select a pre-existing goal from the drop down box in the main window and select "Edit/View"

From here select the "Add button" that opens in the new window beside the words "Subgoal". This will prompt a textbox to open up to name your subgoal. Once saved, the subgoal for that goal will appear as an entry in the list with the "Completed" or "Uncompleted" keyword next to it. 

To close the widget, simply close the window by clicking the red button on the top left of the "Dialog"

### To Delete Goals and Subgoals:
If you come across a goal or subgoal that you do not want, you are given the option to delete it. 

To do this, you much go to the window that the goal or subgoal can be viewed in (picture below) and select that specific goal or subgoal from the dropdown list. To the right you will see a "Delete" button. Once pressed, your goal or subgoal selected will be deleted.

### To Complete Goals and Subgoals:
If you come across a goal of subgoal that you have completed, you are given the option to mark it as completed.

To do this, you much go to the window that the goal or subgoal can be viewed in (picture below) and select that specific goal or subgoal from the dropdown list. To the right you will see a "Complete" button. Once pressed, your goal or subgoal selected will be marked as completed.

Completed goals will be removed from the list of goals, but still viewable when the "Completed Goals" button is selected in the main window. 

We recommend completing goals and subgoals to not only give you, the user, a better understanding of your goals but also, to view accurate statistical analysis on your productivity habits like progress.

Goals turn into overdue goals when the date they are due has passed. If a goal is overdue, you have the option to "Reschedule" your goal to a later date. This can be done by pressing the "Reschedule" button, which will bring open the edit window so you can give youself more time.

View Analysis is something that we provie the user to help better understand productivity habits and offer encouraging helpful tips toward future productivity. 

For full insight, select a completed goal and select the "ViewAnalysis" button

This opens a window that displays a graph of how much time was put into the goal per day.
On top of this, there are several insights that have been made for the user.
